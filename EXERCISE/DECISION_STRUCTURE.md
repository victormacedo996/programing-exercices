1. Triangles:
Make a Program that asks for the 3 sides of a triangle. The program should inform if the values can be a triangle. Indicate, if the sides form a triangle, if it is: equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

    Tips:
    - Three sides form a triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third;
    - Equilateral Triangle: three equal sides;
    - Isosceles Triangle: any two equal sides;
    - Scalene Triangle: three different sides;
